Step-by-Step: Forking & Rebranding MetaMask
🧠 We’ll clone the official MetaMask extension, swap out the visuals and branding, and rebuild it as the Alsania Wallet.

✅ 1. Clone MetaMask Repo
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension alsania-wallet
cd alsania-wallet
✅ 2. Install & Build
Make sure you’re on Node.js v18+ (use nvm if needed).

bash
Copy code
yarn install
yarn dist
This will create a dist/chrome or dist/firefox folder you can load as an extension in dev mode.

🎨 3. Customize Branding
File/Folder	What to Replace
/app/images/metamask-fox.svg	🦊 → Replace with Alsania logo (SVG or PNG)
/app/scripts/onboarding	Splash screen, onboarding flows
/ui/pages	All React UI pages (use find to locate key terms)
/ui/styles	SCSS themes — update colors, shadows, button styles
manifest.json	Name, description, icons, permissions

🔄 Logo Replacement Example:
bash
Copy code
# Replace the fox SVG with your Alsania logo
cp assets/alsania-logo.svg app/images/metamask-fox.svg
You’ll see the logo change on the extension’s popup immediately after reload.

🔁 4. Change Name and Descriptions
Edit in /manifest.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Alsania Wallet",
  "description": "Quantum-resistant Ethereum wallet for Alsania L2",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "icons": {
    "16": "images/alsania-icon-16.png",
    "48": "images/alsania-icon-48.png",
    "128": "images/alsania-icon-128.png"
  }
}
✅ You can also search for "MetaMask" across the repo and replace it with "Alsania Wallet".

🧪 5. Test It in Chrome
Go to chrome://extensions

Enable Developer Mode

Click Load Unpacked

Select the dist/chrome folder

You now have a working Alsania Wallet Chrome extension 🎉

🧠 6. (Optional) Add Quantum Features
Want to support Dilithium signatures?

Add a new key pair module (dilithium-keys.js) inside /app/scripts

Update keyring-controller to handle Dilithium keys (you may need WASM bindings)

Modify UI to allow switching key types or “Upgrading to Quantum”

This is advanced but doable if you’re building a smart wallet backend.

📦 Build for Distribution
bash
Copy code
yarn dist
Then zip the output and upload to:

Chrome Web Store

Firefox Add-ons

Brave / Opera (Chrome compatible)

You said:
is metamask sdk and extension different?


ChatGPT said:
💡 Yes — MetaMask SDK and the MetaMask Extension are very different tools, serving different purposes.

Let’s break this down clearly:

🧰 MetaMask SDK vs Extension: Core Differences
Feature	MetaMask SDK	MetaMask Extension
What it is	A JS/TS library for dApps to connect to MetaMask (incl. mobile)	A browser extension wallet that injects Web3
Purpose	Embed wallet connection in your dApp (Web, Unity, React Native)	Provides the wallet and signing UI (the fox 🦊)
Used by	DApp developers (frontend integration)	End users (wallet app in browser)
Customizable?	You control your dApp UI; SDK just links to MM	Yes, if you fork it — deep customization
Extension Required?	Yes — SDK connects to installed MetaMask (desktop/mobile)	N/A
Mobile Support	✅ Works with MetaMask Mobile	✅ MetaMask Mobile itself
Dilithium or custom sigs?	❌ Not directly	✅ If you fork and modify signing logic

✅ MetaMask SDK Use Case
If you just want to integrate MetaMask into your dApp UI and have users connect easily, the SDK is perfect.

Example:
ts
Copy code
import { MetaMaskSDK } from '@metamask/sdk';

const MMSDK = new MetaMaskSDK({
  dappMetadata: {
    name: 'Alsania DApp',
    url: 'https://alsania.ai',
  },
});

const ethereum = MMSDK.getProvider();
await ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
💡 Use MetaMask SDK for:

DApp UI onboarding

Mobile MetaMask compatibility

Easy integration with Unity, React Native, Flutter, etc.

✅ MetaMask Extension Use Case
If you want to build your own wallet — brand, behavior, and signature logic — you fork the extension.

You get:

Full UI control (replace fox, styling, splash, etc.)

Ability to plug in new signing algorithms (e.g. Dilithium)

Real browser extension with its own name

💡 Use the Extension fork for:

Alsania-branded wallet experience

Quantum-safe auth flows

Native ZK integrations

Unique identity/wallet UX

🔧 Can I Use Both?
Yes! And you probably should:

For Your DApp (Frontend)	Use MetaMask SDK or Web3Modal + ethers.js
For Alsania Wallet (User-side)	Fork MetaMask Extension, customize UX + cryptography

✅ That way:

Builders use your SDK-integrated dApps

Users use your branded wallet (forked extension)

🧠 Summary: Quick Checklist
Use Case	Use This
Build custom wallet UI with your brand	Fork the Extension
Add Dilithium or quantum-safe signature options	Fork the Extension
Connect MetaMask (desktop/mobile) to your dApp	Use MetaMask SDK
Mobile/web2 onboarding flow to MM	SDK + WalletConnect
Extension-level control (icons, UX, signing)	Fork only
